# Skin Cancer Detection Decision Support System (DSS)


## Project Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer globally. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management. This project introduces a robust Decision Support System (DSS) designed to aid in the detection and classification of skin cancer through an easy-to-use interface.


## Key Features

Integrated Classification and Retrieval: Combines advanced machine learning models to provide accurate classification and relevant case retrieval.

Deep Learning Powered: Utilizes transfer learning with pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract meaningful and discriminative features from dermoscopic images.

Ensemble Techniques: Employs Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models in an ensemble approach to enhance classification accuracy.

Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR): Implements CBIR with feature fusion using canonical correlation analysis to match query images with relevant historical cases.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed with clinicians in mind, providing a straightforward and effective tool for querying and receiving feedback on skin lesions.


## Dataset

The system is trained on a dataset of 1,300 dermoscopic images spanning ten different classes of skin conditions.


## Performance

The application of feature fusion and ensemble techniques across all available deep feature spaces has led to the best classification accuracy (85%) and retrieval performance on the test dataset.


Potential Impact

By reducing the reliance on visual observation, which is prone to human error, this system enhances clinical decision-making capabilities, particularly for early screening of skin cancers. It aims to provide dermatologists with a reliable, efficient tool for assessing skin lesions, improving diagnostic accuracy, and potentially saving lives through earlier intervention.
